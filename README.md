# X-Plane-Skyleader-600
Skyleader 600 airplane simulation for X-Plane 10. I created this addon many many years ago and I am no longer interested with developing it. Feel free to fork as required, maybe edit the Blender files to allow export to X-Plane 12 or change instruments or do whatever else you want.
Caution: many of files are in .rar format due to github file size limitation of 25MB. You will need to extract them first.
